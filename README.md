# disease-control

This is the code for the simulation of the project on disease control with SDEs with jumps.
The following describes the different files and how they interact.

# main_simulate.py

This is the main file to run simulations. 
The list of dictionaries named `settings` contains the settings for which the system will be simulated for, for `trials_per_setting` trails.
The results are stored as a .pkl pickled file s.t. analysis can be performed later. Make sure to specifiy the file names as desired to know what name the data is stored under.

# main_evaluate.py

The `names` list of lists contains the names of each of the policies performed in each trial imported.
The `saved` dictionary specifies a mapping from an integer to a filename and names from `names`, s.t. the `all_selected` list corresponds to all saved trials that ought to be analyzed. The for loop specifies what evaluations should be performed.

# dynamics.py

This file implements the class `SISDynamicalSystem` which simulates the dynamical system specified the model under a given policy for a time window, returning the results.
Initialize with the desired parameters.
The ` _simulate` is the core of the class, simulating the arrivals of the counting processes and updating the state variables accordingly. The argument `policy_fun` is a function specifying the desired control policy. It needs to take a time t and return an array of treatment intensities over all nodes. Several other functions call _simulate to have shorthand calls for different policies, e.g. `simulate_opt` or `simulate_trivial` which simulate the system under the stochastic optimal control intensities or trivial control intensities, respectively. 
The function `_getPoissonIntensities` returns the lambdas for `Y`, `W`, and `N` as defined by the model.
` __getOptPolicy(self, t)` implements the optimal policy at time `t`.

# stochastic_processes.py

Implements the class `StochasticProcess`, and `CountingProcess` derived from it. The class is designed to keep track of arrival times and value of the stochastic process over time in a convenient way. The comments should be self explanatory.

# analysis.py

This file implements the class `Evaluation`, made to evaluate `.pkl` result files of `main_simulate.py`. Hence, `main_evaluate.py` instantiates an object of this class. Several functions are implemented to create plots of different metrics.
The function `__integrateF` computes integral from `0` to `T` of `e^(eta * t) * f_of_t * dt` for a given trial, where `f_of_t` is tuple returned by the helper function `step_sps_values_over_time`. The integration is performed by using the fact that all integrals computed in this simulation are piece-wise constant over time windows between arrivals. Thus, the integrals over constant valued time-windows are computed and summed up.

# helpers.py

The class `HelperFunc` impelements helper functions for `dynamics.py` and `analysis.py`. In particular, the extraction of values and arrays from lists of objects of the class `StochasticProcess`.
